## 📘 About This Repository

This repository serves as my **learning log and code collection** for everything related to C.  
Here, I’ll be writing, organizing, and pushing C programs that I create while studying, practicing, and experimenting with.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repo will be organized gradually as I progress. 

## 🧩 Purpose

- To **practice** and **master** the C programming language.  
- To **build a solid foundation** in programming logic and system-level concepts.  
- To have a **personal reference** for C syntax, examples, and common functions.  
- To **track my progress** to advanced.

## ⚙️ Tools & Setup
